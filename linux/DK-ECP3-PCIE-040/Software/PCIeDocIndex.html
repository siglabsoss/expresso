    <h1><u>Lattice PCI Express Software Development Resources</u></h1>

    <H2>Introduction</H2>
    Lattice Semiconductor provides the complete source code for all the PCIe Demos.
    In this context, source code refers to the software compiled to run on a
    Linux 2.6.x kernel PC.  The Verilog HDL is also available, but is located in a separate
    <B>Hardware</B> directory.  Everything dicsussed here is targetted towards the Software
    Engineer building applications for a Linux PC.
    <p>
    The source code packages fall into 3 categories:
    <ol>
	<li><B>Hardware Drivers</B>
	<li><B>API Library</B>
	<li><B>Demo Applications</B>
    </ol>
    <p>
    <a href="#Docs">Documentation</a> is provided for all <a href="#Src">source packages</a>.
    
    
    <H3>Hardware Drivers</H3>
    The Hardware Drivers provide access to the Lattice PCIe Eval Boards.  There
    are currently two drivers used for all the demos.  The lscpcie2.ko driver
    supports the PCIeBasic demo and the PCIeSFIF (Thruput) demo.  The lscdma.ko
    driver supports the PCIeDMA demo.

    <H3>API Library</H3>
    The LSC_PCIeAPI_Lib library provides a DLL (.so) that bridges the user space
    demo applications to the kernel space driver code, and provides routines to 
    control the IP modules.  The PCIeAPI has 2 important functions:
    <ol>
	<li>Interface to the driver - knowledge of how to open each driver type
	and what IOCTL commands it supports.
	<li>Device Classes - OO representations of the IP modules found in hardware
    </ol>
    All demos link with and use this library.  It is common for all demo applications.
    The demo code instantiates classes found in the PCIeAPI library to open access
    to an eval board and creates Device Objects (i.e. GPIO, EBR, SFIF, SGDMA) to
    access the IP modules in the hardware. Consult the PCIeAPI Reference Manual
    for all classes and methods.

    <H3>Demo Applications</H3>
    Demo applications are the demos that the user actually runs.  The demos are
    simple "main()" programs that instantiate classes in the PCIeAPI DLL to
    access and control the hardware.  The demos usually include a GUI, written
    in Java, and a separate text menu application.  The GUI is intended for
    customer demo purposes - its more visually appealing.  The text menu is intended for
    lab testing and a starting point for software engineers to extend the demo.
    The flow of execution is much easier to understand in text menu programs
    than in GUIs.
    <p>
    Three demos are currently provided that demonstrate various uses of the
    PCIe IP:
    <ul>
	<li><B>Basic Demo</B> - shows how to open a driver and send control plane
	type read/writes to registers in the IP (light LEDs, read switches)
	<li><B>Thruput Demo</B> - shows the PCIe IP core's throughput rates for various
	TLP traffic patterns
	<li><B>SGDMA Demo</B> - shows how the SGDMA IP core, used with the PCIe IP core,
	can be setup to transfer data between user space buffers and the eval 
	board IP.
    </ul>
    
    <H2>Development Environments</H2>
    The source code is written in ANSI C/C++ and Java.  
    The demo applications and API library are written in C++.
    The driver code is written in C.
    The Graphical User Interfaces (available in some demos)
    are written in Java.  The following development environments and tools are
    needed to rebuild all source code packages.
    <ul>
	<li>C++ compiler - the standard GNU compiler tools are used for
	all user space C++ development.  It should be available on all Linux installs.
	Standard ANSI makefiles are used to drive the build process.
	<li>Java development - the NeatBeans 5.0 IDE is used for all Java GUIs.
	At this time all Java development is done on Windows.  The resulting JAR files
	are just used in Linux.  See the Windows distribution for the Java source.
	<li>Driver development - the Linux Kernel Module Driver code is written in C
	and builds with the Linux Kernel tools that are installed with the kernel-devel
	pacakge. This package needs to be installed.  The full kernel source tree is
	not necessary.
    </ul>
    Other optional tools used to support building and documentation:
    <ul>
	<li>Python - script language use throughout for various batch editing
	tasks that bash script files can't handle.  Not required to build code, 
	but makes development management tasks easier.
	<li>Doxygen - documentation tools used to generate all the HTML source
	code documentation packages.
	<li>NetBeans - Java GUI IDE used to create the user interfaces for the demos.
    </ul>
