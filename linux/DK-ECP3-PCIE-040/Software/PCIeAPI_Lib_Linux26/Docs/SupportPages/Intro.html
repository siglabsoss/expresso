    The Lattice PCI Express Application Programming Interface (PCIeAPI) Library
    provides all routines needed to interface an application to the PCIe Evaluation
    board.
    <br>

    <br>
    The PCIe API library is a shared library (.so).  It is written in C++ and use Object Oriented design
    practices to abstract the driver interfaces and device object representation.

    The PCIe API contains 3 categories of software:
    <ol>
	<li><B>Driver Interfaces</B>
	<li><B>Functional Device Objects</B>
	<li><B>Utilities</B>
    </ol>

    <H2>Driver Interfaces</H2>
    The API library allows the application to open a driver through a <B>Driver Interface</B> class.
    The important feature of opening a driver is that it gives the application and API library
    the ability to read/write memory on the eval board.
    Each class represents the capabilities of one of the actual device drivers.
    <ul>
	<li><B>PCIe_IF</B> - base class that contains standard PCI/PCIe routines that all drivers
	will need, such as reading the configuration space registers, PCIe capabilities structures,
	displaying driver resource information and reading/writing memory in BARs.
	<li><B>LSCPCIe2_IF</B> - extends the PCIe_IF base class to provide interrupt and common
	buffer DMA support, including kernel memory allocation, extra resource information.
	<li><B>LSCDMA_IF</B> - extends the PCIe_IF base class to provide interrupt support and
	true SG-DMA support using the SGDMA IP core.
    </ul>
    <p>
    The PCIe_IF is typically not used directly.  It is used indirectly by the classes that inherit
    it.
    <p>
    The LSCPCIe2_IF is used to open the lscpcie2 driver.  This driver is used with the PCIe Basic
    demo and the Thruput (SFIF) demo.
    <p>
    The LSCDMA_IF is used to open the lscdma driver.  This driver is used with the PCIe DMA demo.

    
    <H2>Functional Device Objects</H2>
    The API library provides classes that represent the IP modules found in the FPGA demo designs.
    These classes provide methods for common operations on the IP. 
    They are basically user-space functional device drivers.  
    They use the methods provided by the opened Driver Interface to perform the actual hardware
    reads and writes.  The following classes are provided:
    <ul>
	<li><B>GPIO</B> - provides access and routines to use GPIO features - scratchpad, LEDs,
	DIP switch register, etc.
	<li><B>Mem</B> - provides standard linear memory operations for memory type IP objects, 
	such as EBR.
	<li><B>SFIF</B> - provides methods to load the SFIF IP with Tx TLPs, transmit TLPs and 
	read Rx FIFO and counters.  This class is the basic for the PCIe Thruput demo.
	<li><B>SGDMA</B> - provides methods to use the SGDMA channels and buffer descriptors
	from user space.  This class is not directly used in the PCIe DMA demo.  The SGDMA is
	entirely controlled within the driver for speed and effeciency.  This class is mainly
	for experimenting with the SGDMA IP.
    </ul>

    <H2>Utilties</H2>
    Utility classes are also provided.  Some notable ones are:
    <ul>
	<li>formatting memory buffer for display
	<li>debug printing
	<li>getting values of the standard LSC environment variables
    </ul>


    <H2>Usage</H2>
    All demo applications use the PCIeAPI Library.  They all instantiate the appropriate driver
    class and instantiate device object classes that represent the IP modules present in the
    demo hardware.
    <code>
    <pre>
	// Open the DLL and get some diagnostics
	PCIeAPI theDLL;
	printf("Dll version info: %s\n", theDLL.getVersionStr());

	// Opening LSCPCIe2_IF
	pDrvr = new LSCPCIe2_IF(boardName, demoName, boardNum);
	printf("Driver version: %s\n",pDrvr->getDriverVersionStr(infoStr)());

	pGPIO = new GPIO("GPIO",        // a unique name for the IP module instance
                          memGPIO(0),   // its base address
                          pDrvr);       // driver interface to use for register access

	pGPIO->LED16DisplayTest();

    </pre>
    </code>
