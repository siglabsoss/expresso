    A secondary goal of the PCIe API library was to provide a means to
    simulate opening a driver and accessing hardware, even when no eval board
    is available.  This would aid the software developer in unit testing.
    Code development and testing could be done before a full, working
    hardware platform (i.e. eval board and IP design) was available.
    <p>
    The current hardware simulation classes are experimental
    and are not actively used in any demos.  They are idnetified by a
    <B>_sim</B> extension in the class name.
    Although the classes appear in the library (they may one day be expanded
    and prove useful), they should not be used at this time.
