    This page describes how to build the source code into the PCIe API library.
 
    <H2>Build Environment</H2>
    The build environment is the standard GNU C++ compiler. The GNU compiler tools need to be
    installed on your Linux system (almost always are by default).
    The path to the compiler executables must be set in the system PATH variable.
    The compiler and linker are run from the command line, using makefiles.
    <p>
    Before building, the enviroment variable <B>LSC_PCIEAPI_DIR</B> needs to be set to point 
    to the PCIeAPI_Lib top directory.  This variable is used by the Makefiles in the various
    sub-projects to find the PCIeAPI header files and build parameters.
    The easiest way to set up this variable is to run the <b>setup</b> script in the 
    top-level PCIeAPI_Lib directory.  
    Export the lines that are output to set the environment variables in your current
    shell.  You can also add them the environment variables to your .bashrc
    so it will be available in future terminal sessions.

    <H2>Command-line Makefile</H2>
    The PCIeAPI library is only built from the command line.
    Ensure <B>LSC_PCIEAPI_DIR</B> is defined.  
    <p>
    From the top-level <b>PCIeAPI_Lib</b> directory, run any of the following:
    <ul>
	<li><B>make allclean</B> removes all objects files, shared libraries, depends files
	<li><B>make clean</B> to clear any old  object files
	<li><B>make depends</B> auto-computes all file dependencies for building
	<li><B>make debug</B> to build with debugging symbols and event logging
	<li><B>make release</B> to build a release version (optimized, no debugging)
	<li><B>make static</B> to build a release version of a static link library (not a DLL)
	<li><B>make staticD</B> debug verison of above static link library
    </ul>

    A typical sequence of rebuilding the library for development would be:
    <ol>
	<li>make allclean
	<li>make depends
	<li>make debug
    </ol>

    The resulting <B>lscpcieapi.so</B> library file will be in the top level directory.
    This chare library (DLL) will be linked by the application demos.  
    The headers files in the <b>include</b>
    directory are also used by the demos for all the class and library definitions.

    <H2>Version Number</H2>
    The version and a comment
    field are inlcuded into the bld_num.h file and built into the DLL for return with
    API calls.  Maintaining an up-to-date version number and string is done using the
    bld_num.py Python file.  The following shows how to use this command:
    <code>python bld_num.py "Enter a comment here"</code>
    <p>
    If you don't have the Python language installed, you can manually update the .h file and
    the bld_num.txt files prior to rebuilding the DLL.
    
    
    <H2>Structure of the Makefiles</H2>
    The main Makefile is located at the top-level.  It uses the rules.make file for build
    rules, project defines, build options, etc.  rules.make is included by all makefiles.
    The main Makefile invokes each sub-project Makefile in the respective sub-directories.
    Each sub-Makefile is responsible for building its collection of source code files
    into object code.
    <p>
    After all source files in all directories are compiled, the object files are linked together
    into a DLL.
    <p>
    After generation of the DLL, all header files in all sub-directories are copied into the 
    <B>include/</B> directory.  The PCIeAPI <B>include/</B> directory is pointed to by all demo
    application makefiles to find the included header files when the demo is built.
    Do not edit files found in <b>include/</b>, since they will be overwritten with their source copy
    on the next build.
