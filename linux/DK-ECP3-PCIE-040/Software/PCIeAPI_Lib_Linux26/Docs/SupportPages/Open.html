    The PCIeAPI Library provides access to specific hardware device
    drivers.  The device drivers are targetted towards different demo
    capabilities of the Eval Boards. Currently, the two drivers in use
    are <b>lscpcie2</b> and <b>lscdma</b>.
    The PCIeAPI library has a class for each type of supported
    driver.  Instantiating that class opens access to the underlying driver.
    The driver is in fact loaded by init scripts and the hardware is discovered
    with the udev service, and device nodes are automajically added to the 
    /dev tree.   Check the respective driver source trees for details.

    <h2>Specifying what to open</h2>
    <p>
    The drivers support multiple instances, each  assigned to a
    different board.  The library therefore needs to support attaching to
    multiple boards in a system.  For example you could have 3 eval boards
    installed, each with the Thruput demo, and you want to measure system
    throughput with all 3 running at once.  To do this you need to open 3
    Thruput demos, and each needs a way to know which board it will control.
    <p>
    There are 3 important pieces of information needed to connect to a
    specific eval board:
    <ol>
	<li>The board type - SC or ECP2M
	<li>The demo ID - Basic, Thruput, DMA, other
	<li>The board number - 1st board of this type found, 2nd, 3rd
    </ol>
    The PCIeAPI library allows these three parameters to be specified 
    when instantiating the driver interface class.  Some drivers,
    like the lscdma, are targetted for a specific demo.  The lscdma driver
    will only work with the PCIe DMA demo IP.  Therefore the PCIeDMA_IF
    class doesn't require the demo ID to be passed, only the board type
    and the board instance number.
    <p>
    A hardwre device is associated with a specific device driver by declaring
    the device ID fields a driver will support.  The lscpcie2 and lscdma drivers
    each registers a list of PCI vendor, device and subsystem IDs with the
    PCI bus sub-system.  When the OS enumerates the buses it associates the
    devices found with the registered drivers.  When a Lattice board is discovered
    the appropriate driver is called by the kernel.  The "add device" routine 
    in the driver creates a device entry in the <b>/sys/class/lsc.../</b> 
    directory.  This triggers <b>udev</b> to automatically create a device
    entry in the <b>/dev/</b> devices tree.
    The driver (and respective board) is accessed from user space by opening
    the device node filename.
    <p> 
    The board type is specified by a string, whcihc matches the filename in
    the <b>/dev/</b> devices tree.
    Typically a user passes a string constant to the Driver 
    Interface class, such as <B>PCIe_IF::PCIE_ECP2M_BRD</B>.  The constants
    are actually string values:
    <br>
    <code>
    <pre>
	const char *PCIe_IF::PCIE_ECP2M_BRD = "ECP2M";
    </pre>
    </code>
    Substituting any legal string is possible for connection to another
    future board type (experimenting).
    <p>

    Multiple boards of the same type might be installed in the same system.
    There may be two SC eval boards, one with the PCIeBasic demo and one with
    the Thruput demo.  Both demos use the same driver (lscpcie2), so to
    differentiate which one to connect to, the Demo ID string is specified
    which identifies the specific Demo IP (the IP has a unique value pre-set
    in the PCI config registers for each demo type).  Again, a user specifies
    a string constant (or the Driver Interface uses the preset one).
    The board to open is identified by the filename in the <b>/dev/</b> devices tree.
    The Driver Interface agrees with the kernel device driver on the naming
    conventions for the various boards.
    <p>
    The board instance number is used to further narrow down the selection
    process.  If multiple boards use the same driver and have the same Demo IP,
    then the Board Instance number is used to specify exactly which one to
    connect to.  An instance of 1 means the first board found.  An instance of
    2 means the second board found.  "Found" is a relative term based on the
    bus enumeration process of the OS. First may not always refer to the exact
    same physical slot.  It is a relative term, not an absolute location.
    Some experimentation may be needed to determine exactly which board is
    "first" and which is "second", but it does provide a method to identify
    similar boards in the system.

    <h2>In Practice</h2>
    The pre-package Demos allow the user to select which board to open using environment
    variables.  When running the demos via the normal start methods, a script
    file is executed to set environment variables to correspond to the most
    likely eval board and demo to open, i.e. for the ECP2M DevKit, the board
    would default to "ECP2M", and the demo ID would be the demo you are running.
    The script file (something like rundemo.sh) would set the following:
<code>
<pre>
    export LSC_PCIE_BOARD="ECP2M"
    export LSC_PCIE_IP_ID="Basic"
    export LSC_PCIE_INSTANCE=1
</pre>
</code>

    The environment variable string values are passed into the Driver Interface
    creation to create the correct driver interface object.
