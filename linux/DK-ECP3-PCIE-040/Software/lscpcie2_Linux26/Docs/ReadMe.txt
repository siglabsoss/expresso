LSCPCIE2 Driver Documentation Directory
=====================================

The documentation is built here, using the Doxygen utility.
The resulting HTML documentation is placed in the html/
directory.  The ReferenceManual.html file can be used to link to
the resutling index.html file.  Index.html is the main
page of the documentation.

The various html files located in this directory contain the
extra pages of info related to building the driver, describing
the source code, etc.

Build the documentation using:
	doxygen lscpcie2.doxy
OR
	makedocs.bat  - this copies all necessary files into the html directory
