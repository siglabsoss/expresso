    <H2>Linux Kernel Development</H2>
    Driver development requires the Linux Kernel Development Package.  This package provides
    the kernel API header files and build environment for compiling the source code.
    The standard user-space header files and libraries can not be used.
    You will need to ensure the kernel header files are present.  They are normally located
    in <b>/usr/src/kernels/{version}/include/linux</b> or run <b>rpm -q kernel-devel</b> to
    so if the package is installed.
    <p>
    If you do not have the kernel development package, you will need to search the web for 
    an RPM to download and install.  The RPM must match your kernel version and architecture
    exactly (i.e. i686 or x64 or SMP).  Use <b>uname -a</b> to get the exact kernel version
    you are running.
    <p>
    The following site can be used to locate an RPM package:

    <H2>Building</H2>
    Building the driver is done from the command shell using the provided Makefile.
    The driver is simply built with <b>make</b>.  You do not need to be root
    to compile the driver module.  The resulting file will be <b>lscpcie2.ko</b>.
    You do need to be root to install it into the kernel.
    A version string can be set in the source which can provide a
    unique identification for the software that uses the driver (i.e. to make sure you
    are really running the version you just compiled!)
    

    <H2>Installing</H2>
    The driver can be installed using the <b>insdrvr</b> script for testing.  You will
    need to unload any currently installed driver using <b>rmdrvr</b> before installing
    the new one - insmod will complain otherwise.
    <p>
    Diagnostic outputs can be enabled with the debug parameter.  Specify <b>insdrvr debug=1</b> 
    to enable logging.  Messages can be viewed using <b>dmesg</b>.  The prinkt() function 
    is used to send output to the log.
    <p>
    If you do not get any errors, then you can assume the module is installed.  You can double
    check with <b>dmesg</b> or <b>lsmod</b> or <b>cat /proc/driver/lscpcie2</b>.
    <p>
    For permanent installation on the system and auto-loading of the driver when the system
    starts, its probably easiest to run the following script files commands:
    <ul>
 	<li>From the Software directory:
	<ul>
		<li>make drivers
	</ul>
 	<li>From the Demonstration directory (as root):
	<ul>
		<li>./removeDrvr.sh
		<li>./installDrvr.sh
	</ul>
    </ul>
    This will rebuild the driver, copy it to the expected locations in Demonstration/, remove
    the old driver from the system files and locations, and then install the new one.

  
    <H2>Running</H2>
    Use the demo applications to open and exercise the driver or see the <b>tests</b> directory
    for examples of basic driver operation, but not related to any specific demo.
    <p>
	A Lattice PCIe Eval board, with a proper demo bitstream, must be installed in the system
	in order for the driver to actually create device nodes and therefore allow a user program
	to open and use it.  You will need a hardware device for the driver to really exercise
	its functionality.  Otherwise only the init and remove functions will be executed.

    <H2>Debugging</H2>
	Diagnostic messages and errors are output to the system log (/var/log/messages).
	The <b>dmesg</b> command will also display printk messages from the kernel.
	Remember to load the driver with the debug=1 option to enable all messages to
	come out - errors and warnings will always be logged.
