The PCIe Basic Demo Menu Program (see <a class="el" href="_p_c_ie__menu_8cpp.html">PCIe_menu.cpp</a>) illustrates basic read/write operations over the PCIe bus to registers in the demo IP of the Lattice FPGA. This provides the basis for a Control Plane type application over the PCIe bus. The demo also displays the PCI registers and PCIe Capabilities structures that are in the Core and configured by the Root Complex. <p>
The Menu provides a command line interface to inter-actively exercise the GPIO registers and EBR memory. <p>
The flow of execution shows the following: <ol>
<li>
Instantiate the lscpcie2 driver interface to open access to the device driver. </li>
<li>
Use the driver methods to display info about the driver and the PCIe config registers. </li>
<li>
Create a GPIO object that then provides all the methods for exercising the LEDs, counter logic and reading the DIP switches. </li>
<li>
Create an EBR object that then provides all the methods for testing reading/writing access to the EBR memory. </li>
<li>
Create a BAR object that then provides read/write access to any memory location; used for peeking and poking; diagnostics. </li>
<li>
Launch the menu for inter-active selection of tests to run. </li>
<li>
When done, clean-up and return. </li>
</ol>
<p>
The menu provides the same functionality as the GUI, but may be easier to follow from the view point of a software developer looking to see how to open the driver and use the classes and methods provided in the PCIeAPI library to access IP in the FPGA.<p>
The specific Evaluation Board to open and access is provided via environment variables. The following environment variables are typically set via a config batch file or with the PCIeScan utility prior to running this application: <ul>
<li>
<b>LSC_PCIE_BOARD</b> = PCI Vendor and Device string of the board to open </li>
<li>
<b>LSC_PCIE_IP_ID</b> = "subsys_53031204" subsystem ID = demo IP ID </li>
<li>
<b>LSC_PCIE_INSTANCE</b> = instance of board to open, typically 1, the first </li>
</ul>
