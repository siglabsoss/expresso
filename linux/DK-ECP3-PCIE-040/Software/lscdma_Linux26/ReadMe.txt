Lattice Semiconductor Linux Kernel Driver for SGDMA over PCIe

This directory tree contains the source and tests for the lscdma device driver
project that is used to access compatible Lattice PCIe Evaluation Boards that
are loaded with the DMA demo IP.

The drvr/ directory contains the source and README for building and installing
the device driver.


The Tests/ directory contains user-mode test applications that verify the
driver is installed and communicating with a board, without running any Demo/IP
specific operations.
