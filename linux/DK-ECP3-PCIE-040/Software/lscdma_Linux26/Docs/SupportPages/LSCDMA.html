    <H2>Driver Source Code</H2>
    The <b>lscdma</b> driver is a Linux 2.6.x based PCI style device driver.
    The driver uses the Linux device model introduced in the 2.6 kernel to register the driver and
    devices in the /sys/class tree and have them known to the system and user.
    The driver source is divided among various files, each implementing certain
    funtionality.  An explanation of the files follows:

    <ul>
	<li><b>Main.c</b> - contains the driver entry, add device and unload routines.
         Also contains the handlers for all system calls, such
	as opening a file, closing a file, reading, writing and ioctl commands.
	<li><b>DMA.c</b> - contains the routines to construct Scatter-Gather Lists in Linux and
	invoke the SGDMA IP configuration routines to setup the transfers.
	<li><b>Devices.c</b> - contains the Lattice IP specifics.  Routines for reading and writing registers
	in the allocated BAR space, handling the SGDMA IP, handling the Interrupt Controller IP, etc.
	<li><b>ISR.c</b> - contains the ISR and DPC used for processing SGDMA interrupts when a transfer
	is complete
	<li><b>lscdma.h</b> - contains all definitions for the driver - data structures, prototypes, etc.
	<li><b>Ioctl.h</b> - contains the definitions of all the supported interfaces/access points between
	the driver and user space code.  All shared structures, constants and IOCTL commands are defined here.
	<li><b>GPIO.h</b> - contains register definitions for the GPIO IP module used in the demo
	<li><b>SGDMA.h</b> - contains register definitions for the SGDMA IP module used in the demo
	<li><b>sysDefs.h</b> - contains data type definitions to port so types used in the driver code to Linux
	<li><b>9-lscdma.rules</b> - the <b>udev</b> rules for creating device nodes in the <b>/dev</b> tree
	<li><b>insdrvr</b> - script file to manually install the driver; used mainly for development and testing
	<li><b>rmdrvr</b> - script file to manually remove the driver; used mainly for development and testing 

    </ul>

    <p>
    All global functions are prefixed with <B>lscdma_</B> to indicate they belong to this driver.


    <H2>Loading the Driver</H2>
    The driver is loaded into the Linux kernel by a system call.  
    There are two ways to load a driver.  The choice depends on 
    usage: development or automated.
    <ul>
	<li><b>insdrvr</b> - use the script file to insert the driver manually for development purposes.
	This script uses the <b>insmod</b> system call to load the driver module into the kernel.
	<li><b>init script</b> - the DevKit install script will add to the init file /etc/rc.d/rc.local
	a line to execute the modprobe call for the respective drivers, which then uses the kernel's
	automated services to load registered modules based on hardware discovered.   
    </ul>

    For standard operations, the driver is installed and loaded automatically by the system when the OS starts.

	<p>
	For a detailed overview of the driver loading operations see the lscpcie2 driver reference manual.
	The same sequences apply to the lscdma driver also.


    <H2>How a DMA Device is Opened</H2>

    This driver supports 2 devices to DMA to/from.  The ColorBars device provides image data to be written
    into PC memory.  The ImageMove device is actually an EBR.  It can be written to and read from.
    Currently the demo IP (and the driver) only support 1 DMA read channel and 1 DMA write channel.
    That being the case, only one device (ColorBars or ImageMove) can be open at a time, since they
    both need atleast the write channel.
    To indicate which device the SGDMA will be moving data to/from, the user opens the similarly
    named device file, i.e. ECP2M_DMA_1_CB refers to opening the first ECP2M board, to DMA from the
    ColorBars device (CB=ColorBars, IM=ImageMove). Each hardware device actually has 3 device files
    corresponding to it:
	<ol>
		<li> Minor 0 = basic register access
		<li> Minor 1 = ColorBars access
		<li> Minor 2 = ImageMove access
	</ol>
    <p>
    Linux invokes the driver's lscdma_open() function.  This is the same driver entry point that gets
    invoked when opening a disk file.  The driver extracts the minor number and knows which device was opened.
    The minor number referes to whether the user opened the ColorBars file or the ImageMove file.
    <p>
    The lscdma_open() also checks to make sure no other devices are opened.  If so it exits with
    an error code (-EBUSY).  This provides the mututal exclusion.

    <H2>How the SGDMA is Started</H2>
    Once the user opens a "file", which represents the IP device, standard file read and writes are
    done to perform the actual data movement.  This works just like reading or writing data to a disk
    file.  The lscdma_read() is used to read data from an IP device.  This actually translates
    into PCIe MWr operations.  The data is written into the PC memory.
    <p>  
    The lscdma_write() is used to write data to an IP device.  
    This actually translates into PCIe MRd operations.  The data is read from the PC memory.
    <p>
    The lscdma_read() function checks to make sure that all hardware resources are available
    and enabled.  This includes interrupt support and DMA adapter allocation. Also it makes sure the
    file object is still valid and not in the process of being abruptly closed by the user (i.e.
    the user process crashed or aborted).  Next the user's read request put onto a wait queue.
    This blocks the user process.  It acts just like reading from a disk.  The read() function call
    will not return until all data has been transfered into the user's buffer.  Next the SGDMA is
    programmed to move the data.
    <p>
    The lscdma_write() function checks the driver settings just like above.
    The user's write request is placed on a wait queue.
    This blocks the user process.  It acts just like writing to a disk.  The write() function call
    will not return until all data has been transfered from the user's buffer into the device hardware.
    Next the SGDMA is programmed to move the data.

    <H2>How Memory is Mapped</H2>
    The driver uses true Scatter-Gather Direct Memory Access techniques to move the data between
    user virtual memory space and the device PCIe address space.  The data buffers specified in the
    read and write function calls are in the virtual address space of the demo process.  These
    addresses do not correspond to real, physical memory addresses in PC system memory.  The SGDMA IP
    requires linear, physical memory addresses.  The driver uses kernel memory management functions
    to get a list of all the physical pages that comprise the user's virtual buffer.
    pci_map_sg() is the primary function that does this.  It creates a list of [starting address,
    length] pairs for each page of memory that makes up the user's buffer.  For example, the ColorBars
    moves 1 MB of data.  This is equal to 256 4KB pages.  A scatter-gather list 
    containing 256 entries will be created, each with a specific start address and length.  Sometimes
    adjacent pages can be allocated, and so the actual number of entries may be less than 256,
    with some having lengths of 8KB or 12KB because multiple, contiguous pages are combined into one entry.
    <p>
    The Scatter-Gather list is used in the StartDmaWrite() and StartDmaRead() functions.
    These functions program the SGDMA core to move as much data as is available in the mapping.
    Currently the entire transfer size must fit within the SG-List.  The code does not support moving
	a sub-set of the entire transfer, releasing the SG-List then re-allocating a new list for the
	next part of the transfer.

    <H2>How the SGDMA IP is Setup</H2>
    The SGDMA IP core is configured by routines in the Devices.cpp file.  SGDMA_EnableChan() is used
    to program the channel's globabl configuration registers.  The channel is determined based on
    the direction of the transfer.  Writes into the PC (read()) are done using channel 0.  Reads from
    the PC (write()) are done using channel 1.  The channel registers that need configuring are the
    Buffer Descriptor start, arbiter settings, event masks, etc.
    <p>
    The channel's buffer descriptors are then programmed in SGDMA_ConfigWrite() or SGDMA_ConfigRead(), 
    depending on the direction of the transfer.  These routines take the SG list data and program each
    buffer descriptor to move the specified length to/from the PC physical address.
    The SGDMA buffer descriptors are the hardware equivalents of the SG list.
    <p>
    Once the channel is setup, it is triggered to run and the driver code returns to the kernel.
    The user process is blocked, waiting for the transfer to complete.  The kernel returns control
    to some other process in the system.


    <H2>How the SGDMA Operates</H2>
    The SGDMA IP Core moves data from a source interface to a destination interface.  In this example, the
    one interface is connected to the PCIe IP core and the other interface to the ColorBars and EBR slave
    devices.  Both interfaces are Wishbone compliant masters that initiate bus transactions.
    The SGDMA processes the buffer descriptor list for a channel.  It starts with the first buffer descriptor
    and loads the source starting address and length, and the destination address.  The DMA then performs
    Wishbone bus cycles to read the data from the source and move it to and write it out onto the destination
    bus.  After all the data for a buffer descriptor is moved, the next buffer descriptor is accessed and
    the next move is programmed with its information.  This continues until the last buffer descriptor
    is read and the transfer completed.
    <p>
    The following example shows how moving data from the EBR to the PC memory might occur.
    <ol>
	<li> Read first buffer descriptor
	<li> setup to read from Bus B, EBR, base address 0, length 4096 bytes
	<li> setup to write to Bus A, PCIe, starting address from SG list (PC memory)
	<li> setup to do writes in bursts of 128 bytes (max TLP size)
	<li> start transfer of this buffer descriptor
	<li> read next buffer descriptor
	<li> setup the new source, destination and transfers as before
	<li> start transfer of this buffer descriptor
	<li> continue with all buffer descriptors in list until last one is done
	<li> generate interrupt signalling everything is moved
    </ol>

    <p>
    The SGDMA is configured to generate an interrupt when it has finished moving all the data specified
    by the buffer descriptors of a channel.  This interrupt invokes the driver's ISR, which gets the
    driver involved in completing the transfer from the software side.

    <H2>Completing the Transfer</H2>
    The driver's ISR is executed after the SGDMA transfers all the programmed data.  The ISR clears
    interrupts on the board and disables any further interrupts.  (Nested interrupts are not supported
    by this code or the IP).  The Deffered Procedure Call (DPC) is then scheduled to run.  The CPU returns
    from interrupt context and the hardware can not interrupt again.
    <p>
    The DPC examines the SGDMA registers to see the reason for the interrupt.  Upon successful completion
    of moving data, the driver cleans up the SGDMA IP by disabling the
    channel so it can not interrupt or run anymore and releases any system resources that may be
    outstanding, such as  SG lists.  The driver then unblocks the wait queue.
    The callers orignal operation then continues and returns the completion status and number of bytes moved.
    <p>
    The user process returns from the read() or write() and has the exact same return info as if it
    had done a disk file access.  The success or failure is returned, along with the number of bytes
    actually transfered and if it was a read, then the caller's buffer has all the transferred data in it.


    <H2>Closing the Device</H2>
    Closing the DMA device is done with a standard close() call.  
    Closing is performed when the user is all done reading or writing.
    It is just like closing a disk file.  You do not need to close after one read() before doing
    another read().
    <p>
    Closing and clean-up is done in lscdma_close().
    This causes any outstanding DMA requests to be marked as cancelled.  
    If the user process aborts or crashes, the driver is
    notified via the wait queue being unblocked by a signal.  
    <p>
    The driver does not gracefully handle an io request timeout.  To be fully user-friendly, a timer should
    be started when an read/write request is first processed.  If the operation is not completed within a certain
    amount of time (10 seconds) the request is automatically cancelled and control returned to the user
    process with a failure status.  This timeout is not currently implemented.  What this means is 
    that if the hardware hangs and does not complete the transfer, the user's read or write will
    also hang.  The demo will need to be closed with Ctrl-C or by closing the window.  It won't gracefully
    recognize that its hung and exit on its own.



    <H2>Debug Output</H2>
    The driver contains debug macros that send output to the system log (if the driver was installed with the
    option <b>debug=1</b>).
    The system log can be viewed with <b>tail -f /var/log/messages</b> (need to be root).

    Information about opening the
    device, executing a read or write, SG List allocation, SGDMA operations, etc. will all be printed to
    the DebugView utility.
